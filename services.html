                                When purchasing a home, the buyer should always receive a deed, which is a legal
                                document that transfers ownership of the property from the seller to the buyer. The deed
                                should be recorded with the local government, typically with the county clerk, and will
                                serve as proof of ownership. The deed should include the name of the buyer, the seller,
                                and a description of the property, including the address. Other documents that may be
                                included with the purchase of a home include a title report, surveys, and other legal
                                documents such as closing documents.

                            <h4>Property Registration Buying and Selling</h4>
                            <p>Property registration is the process of registering the sale or purchase of a property
                                with the relevant authorities. This process is necessary for legal proof of ownership,
                                and to ensure that all legal documents are in order. The registration process also helps
                                to protect the interests of both the buyer and the seller.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The process of registering a property usually involves completing a registration form,
                                paying a registration fee, and providing relevant documentation. The form will usually
                                require information such as the name and address of the buyer, the seller, and any other
                                parties involved in the transaction. The buyer and seller must also provide proof that
                                they are legally allowed to buy and sell the property, such as a deed or title.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Once the registration form has been completed, the property must be inspected by a
                                qualified surveyor. This surveyor will check that the property meets all legal
                                requirements, such as zoning laws and building codes. Then, the property must be
                                registered with the relevant authorities. This may include the local municipality, the
                                state land registry, or the national land registry.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The registration process can vary depending on the type of property being purchased. For
                                example, residential properties require a different set of documents than commercial
                                properties. Additionally, the registration process may take longer in certain
                                jurisdictions.</p>

                            <h4>Wet Land Convertion (Nanjai)</h4>
                            <p>Wetland conversion is the process of converting wetland habitats into land for
                                agricultural or other uses. In Nanjai, this process has been used to convert wetlands
                                into rice paddies, ponds, and other agricultural uses. This has resulted in the loss of
                                valuable habitat for wildlife, increased soil erosion, and other environmental impacts.
                                To mitigate these impacts, Nanjai has implemented a number of measures, including the
                                establishment of buffer zones, water management systems, and other conservation
                                measures. Additionally, they have worked to restore degraded wetlands by planting native
                                vegetation, controlling weeds, and providing habitat for native species. These efforts
                                have helped improve the health of local wetland ecosystems, and have allowed for the
                                sustainable use of the land.

                                works projects such as roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. The PWD may acquire

                                through a process known as a Non-Occupancy Certificate (NOC). The NOC is a certificate
                                granted by the local government that authorizes the transfer of ownership of unoccupied
                                land from one individual to another. The NOC is typically used to transfer land from a
                                private owner to the government for public use.

                            <h4>Property litigation Solutions</h4>
                            <p>Property litigation solutions may involve various strategies and tactics to resolve
                                disputes involving real estate. Some of the most common solutions include negotiation,
                                arbitration, mediation, and litigation. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Negotiation: Negotiation is a process in which parties attempt to reach a mutually
                                beneficial agreement without having to resort to the courts. It involves mutual
                                discussion and compromise to come up with a solution.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Arbitration: Arbitration is a dispute resolution process in which a neutral third party,
                                called an arbitrator, renders a decision after reviewing the evidence presented by both
                                parties. The arbitrator's decision is binding and may be enforceable in court. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Mediation: Mediation is a process in which a neutral third party, called a mediator,
                                helps the parties reach a mutually agreeable resolution of their dispute. Mediation is
                                often used to resolve disputes over the ownership or use of real estate. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Litigation: Litigation is the process of taking a dispute to court. When a dispute is
                                litigated, each party presents their case to a judge or jury, who makes a decision based
                                on the evidence presented. The decision of the court is final and binding.</p>
